                    When you think of a candy store, you might expect to be assulted by rainbows, sparkles, and happiness. Well, there's none of that here, just like how life isn't all rainbows and sparkles. Here, we embrace the darkness. No one is safe, everyone feels it, some more than others. We are here to say that's ok. It's ok to not be ok, and on those especially bad days, we got you.

                    We're not going to sugar coat it. But actually... yes we are. That is exactly what we are trying to do. Sugar coat life so that it sucks a bit less for a while. Not everyone is up for the rainbows and sparkles of life, we get it. Take a walk on the dark side with us with our black and white colored candy. <br>Let us know what you think <a class="paragraph-link" href="mailto:candemo@gmail.com?subject = Feedback&body = Message">

                    We know, and we love it. That's why our candy is themed off of some of the most iconic Emo songs. If you don't see your favorite on the list, well, life sucks, remember? But chances are, you will like one of the songs, and if you can't remember how one goes, or if your are someone's grandma who is trying to be supportive (we love you Grandma), then check out our <a class="paragraph-link" href="music.html">Spotify playlist</a> for an Emo-musication.

                    Trust us. Or not, we're just a candy company. But one thing we know is that for us, candy and Emo music are things to live for. Life is a whole lot better with those things in it, just like it's better with you in it. Check out our <a class="paragraph-link" href="life.html">Lifeline Page</a> for help when life sucks a little too much.<br><br> And if you are feeling ok right now, you will feel even better knowing that with every candy purchase, 10% of the profit goes to these lifesaving organizations.
